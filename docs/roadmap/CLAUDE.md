# Roadmap Docs

Planning, milestones, and prioritization.

## Conventions

- Update status inline rather than creating new files
- Use checkboxes for milestone tracking
- Archive completed or abandoned plans

## Lifecycle

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Item prioritized for implementation | Create PRD in `product/`, mark item "in progress" |
| Item completed | Archive roadmap item, link to shipped product doc |
| Item abandoned | Archive with rationale |

## Content Types

- Release milestones
- Feature priorities
- Quarterly/annual planning
- Dependency maps

## Relationship to Product

Roadmap captures intent and sequencing. When work begins, a PRD in `product/` captures the detailed requirements. The roadmap item tracks status; the PRD tracks specification.
