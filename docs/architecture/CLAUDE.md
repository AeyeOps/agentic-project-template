# Architecture Docs

Authoritative technical specifications. Content here represents current system design.

## Conventions

- Update in place rather than versioning (use ADRs for decision history)
- Include diagrams where they clarify (Mermaid preferred)
- Reference the ADR that led to each major design choice
- Structure: problem, constraints, design, consequences

## Content Types

- Component specifications
- Integration patterns
- Data models and schemas
- API contracts
- Deployment architecture

## Relationship to Other Directories

- `discovery/` explores options; `architecture/` records the chosen design
- `adr/` captures why; `architecture/` captures what and how
- `product/` defines requirements; `architecture/` shows how they're met
