# Archive

Superseded and deprecated content. Reference only.

## Conventions

- First line of archived content: `> Superseded by: [replacement](../path)`
- Preserve original content unchanged for historical context
- Naming: keep original filename, optionally prefix with archive date

## Why Archive

Archived docs preserve decision rationale and evolution history. When questions arise about past decisions, the archive provides context that ADRs alone may not capture.

## What Belongs Here

- Previous versions of PRDs
- Completed or abandoned roadmap items
- Superseded architecture designs
- Deprecated API specifications
